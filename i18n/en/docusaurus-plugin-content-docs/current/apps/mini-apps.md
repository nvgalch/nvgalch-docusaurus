# VK Mini Apps

**VK Mini Apps** is an open platform for embedded cross-platform apps that expand the capabilities of the VKontakte website and app. We call such apps mini apps.

VK Mini Apps relies on a universal approach and uses standard web technologies such as HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to develop mini apps.

With VKontakte, you can create mini apps for:

* Mobile apps (Android, iOS).
* Mobile version of the website ([m.vk.com](https://m.vk.com/)).
* Desktop version of the website ([vk.com](https://vk.com/)).

Mini apps can be placed:
* In the [VK catalog](https://vk.com/services).
* On [Odnoklassniki](https://ok.ru).
<!--* On the mobile version of the [Atom browser](https://browser.ru/) for Android.-->

## Advantages

* Mini apps are cross-platform: you can create mini apps for Android, iOS, and computers on one platform.
* Users can interact with VKontakte (for example, publish stories, join communities) without leaving a mini app.
* A variety of monetization options that are easy to enable.
* Being able to quickly launch your own project.
* An opportunity to test your idea on a large and active audience of VKontakte.
* Large community of like-minded people and support from the VK Team.
